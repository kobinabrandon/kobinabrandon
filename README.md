### Who am I?
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage. 

After studying Mathematics for much of my early adult life, I now build end-to-end machine learning systems (preferably trained on living datasets) that solve problems I care about. I genuinely enjoy programming, take immense pride in whatever I'm able to create, and am constantly looking for ways to expand my skills. 


### How I Work
I impose certain standards upon myself.

- I commit to produce code that meets the highest standards of quality that my skills will allow at any given time.

- Whenever possible, I favour developing end-to-end applications. This means that I almost always opt for writing modular code in scripts as opposed to Jupyter notebooks. As a result, I try to keep my use of Jupyter notebooks to an absolute minimum, and only use them for EDA (exploratory data analysis), and to quickly test bits of code.

- I don't use AI coding assistants. In their current and most popular configurations, these tools often suggest code before one has even had the opportunity to think independently, repeatedly encouraging us to choose their suggestions over our own thoughts. I fear that over time, this pattern of behaviour may cause our skills to atrophy, creating dependency and feelings of discomfort in habitual users who are suddenly forced to do without them.

- I only use LLMs when I have specific questions about language features, hypothetical scenarios, programming concepts, or about how functions within a given library work. 

### Recently Deployed Projects
I recently built a [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/Hourly-Divvy-Trip-Predictor) that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. You can try it out [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/).

### Ongoing Projects
I'm working on multiple projects:
- A RAG web application of personal signifance to me (the repository is private).
- An [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/automated-tyre-defect-detection) that detects defective tyres, a crucial operation for safeguarding modern tyre manufacturing pipelines.
- A batch scoring [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/batch-systems-for-lyft-bikes) that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures in all every city were Lyft offers bikeshare services. 
- A real-time system[system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/real-time-systems-for-lyft-bikes) that checks the number of free bikes available at various locations within each bikeshare system currently run by Lyft.
- A language translation [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/translate-with-transformers)


### Other Interests
- Beyond my personal professional goals, I would like to somehow apply my skills to contribute in some small way to the technological and economic advancement of my fellow Africans.
- I deeply enjoy programming, and I have an interest in other fields of software engineering (and languages other than Python), though machine learning engineering remains my focus.
- I'm learning and enjoying [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), and I invite you to try it.
- I'm slowly Rust and Go.
