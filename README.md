### Who am I?
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage. 

After studying Mathematics for much of my early adult life, I took an interest in machine learning and data science. Now I build complete end-to-end ML systems (preferably trained on living datasets) that solve problems I care about. 

### Other Interests
- Beyond my personal professional goals, I would like to somehow apply my skills to contribute in some small way to the technological and economic advancement of my fellow Africans.
- I also harbour a growing interest in embedded machine learning, as I'd like to be able to extend the functionality of cameras, sensors, and other devices so that they can serve new purposes. For this reason, I am interested in adding a lower level compiled language to my skillset.
