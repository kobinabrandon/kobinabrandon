### Who am I?
I'm a Applied Machine Learning Engineer of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage. 

I studied Mathematics for much of my early adult life, culminating in doctoral studies at the University of Liverpool. I now build end-to-end machine learning systems that solve problems I care about. I genuinely enjoy programming, take a great deal of pride in whatever I'm able to create, and am constantly looking for ways to expand my skills. 

### Why Then Is My Github So Empty?
I've moved [all of my repositories](https://codeberg.org/kobinabrandon?tab=repositories) to Codeberg (a community-run git hosting service owned a German non-profit). 

I'm not comfortable with Microsoft's use of open source code on Github to train the model behind Github Copilot without our permission, and I believe that in doing so, they've gone against the spirit of the copyleft open source licences. I believe that this is a deeply unethical practice, and that vendor lock-in is being used to hold developers hostage on Github while Microsoft work as hard as they can to automate de away under the guise of making it "easier" - and profiting from developers' increasing dependency on LLMs in the process.

### Why is this account still here then?
- I will be using this account to contribute to open source projects that are hosted on Github. I'd rather not have any of my code here, but I can't do anything about the decisions others make about where they host their repos.
- I am keeping one of my projects here. It's an end-to-end ML [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/Hourly-Divvy-Trip-Predictor) that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. You can interact with it [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/). The project has a number of forks (all of which are currently inactive), and deleting it would remove the evidence that I am its original author. Active development of the system will continue on Codeberg.
