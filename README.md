<h1 align="center">Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> <a href="https://nogithub.codeberg.page">

<h2 style="color: #e5b01c" align="center">Nearly all my repositories have been migrated to <a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/kobina.seednode.xyz">Radicle</a>!</h2>
</br>

I am however keeping one an archived version of one of my MLOps projects [here]((https://github.com/kobinabrandon/Hourly-Divvy-Trip-Predictor). It's an end-to-end ML system that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. You can interact with the app [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/). The version of the project here on Github is deprecated, and the project is under active development on my [seed node](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/kobina.seednode.xyz/rad:zVhC4MGvgB8YMjvBuBNoQsSGtac6) on the [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) network.

I may use this account to contribute to open source projects that are hosted on Github, or to do work for organisations that require me to use Github.
