### Who am I? 

I'm a mathematician who's aspiring to be an excellent Machine Learning Engineer (MLE). 

### Why did I choose this career path? 

I did a PhD in Maths (Algebraic Geometry) and decided that a career in academia wasn't for me, and that I'd rather make use of my mathematical and statistical knowledge to build things that make me money by making even more money for other people.

I am of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage, and I would also like to somehow apply my budding skills to contribute in some small way to the scientific, technological, and economic advancement of the African continent and its people. 

With that being said, I think that above all other technologies, machine learning models have the ability to turn our world into a dystopian hellhole depending on how they are used, and I think that MLEs should be cognisant of that when selecting projects and jobs.

I'm determined to complete end-to-end ML projects of various kinds to grow my skills.

### Ongoing Projects & Interests
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
   -  a Streamlit web application that predicts user demand for the City of Chicago's Divvy bike-sharing service.
   -  deploying an exchange rate prediction service as a REST API. I'm learning about FastAPI for this reason.
   -  creating and deploying a real-time exchange rate data pipeline. My hope is to leverage this project into a way for me to learn how to build real-time machine learning systems.

- ðŸŒ± No matter how accurate a model is, it has no business value if it hasn't been deployed as a useable service which displays actionable predictions in a manner that is appealing and easy to understand. Iâ€™m currently learning different methods of doing exactly that.
   
- ðŸ‘¯ At this time, Iâ€™m open to collaborating with others on virtually any project, as I'm eager to learn about as many machine learning architectures and tools as possible.
