<h1 align="center">Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> <a href="https://nogithub.codeberg.page">

<h2 style="color: #e5b01c" align="center">Nearly all my repositories have been migrated to <a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/kobina.seednode.xyz">Radicle</a>!</h2>

I am however keeping one of my MLOps projects here on Github. It's an end-to-end ML system that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. You can interact with the app [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/). 

The rest of my work is under active development on my personal Radicle [node](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/kobina.seednode.xyz).
I may use this account to contribute to open source projects that are hosted here, or to do work for organisations that require me to use Github.
