### Who am I?
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage. 

After studying Mathematics for much of my early adult life, I now build end-to-end machine learning systems (preferably trained on living datasets) that solve problems I care about. I genuinely enjoy programming, take immense pride in whatever I'm able to create, and am constantly looking for ways to expand my skills. 


### How I Work
I impose certain standards upon myself.

- I commit to produce code that meets the highest standards of quality that my skills will allow at any given time.

- Whenever possible, I favour developing end-to-end applications. This means that I almost always opt for writing modular code in scripts as opposed to Jupyter notebooks. As a result, I try to keep my use of Jupyter notebooks to an absolute minimum, and only use them for EDA (exploratory data analysis), and to quickly test bits of code.

- I don't use AI coding assistants. In their current and most popular configurations, these tools often suggest code before one has even had the opportunity to think independently, repeatedly encouraging us to choose their suggestions over our own thoughts. I fear that over time, this pattern of behaviour may cause our skills to atrophy, creating dependency and feelings of discomfort in habitual users who are suddenly forced to do without them.

- I only use LLMs when I have specific questions about language features, hypothetical scenarios, programming concepts, or about how functions within a given library work. 

### Ongoing Open Source Projects
- A [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/Hourly-Divvy-Trip-Predictor) that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. I have deployed it [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/).
- A computer vision [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/automated-tyre-defect-detection) that detects defective tyres, a crucial operation for safeguarding modern tyre manufacturing pipelines.
- A language translation [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/translate-with-transformers)

### Private Projects
My most active private repositories generally revolve around code that I intend to monetise. My most ambitious project to date falls into this category, and I'm hoping that I'll make enough from it to support the costs of hosting. It will require me to acquire write code that extends well beyond machine learning.

### Other Interests
- Beyond my personal professional goals, I would like to somehow apply my skills to contribute in some small way to the technological and economic advancement of my fellow Africans.
- I want to be able to use languages other than Python when necessary, so I'm actively learning Go, and have started dipping my toes into Rust.
- I have an interest in other fields of software engineering, though machine learning engineering remains my focus.
- I enjoy [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), and I invite you to try it.
