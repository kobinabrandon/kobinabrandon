<h1 align="center">Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> <a href="https://nogithub.codeberg.page">

<h2 style="color: #e5b01c" align="center">If you are looking for my repositories, nearly all of them have been migrated to <a href="https://codeberg.org/kobinabrandon">Codeberg</a>!</h2>
</br>

I am however keeping one of my MLOps projects here. It's an end-to-end ML [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/Hourly-Divvy-Trip-Predictor) that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. You can interact with it [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/).

I may use this account to contribute to open source projects that are hosted on Github, or to do work for organisations that require me to use Github.
