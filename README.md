### Who am I?
I'm a Applied Machine Learning Engineer of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage. 

I studied Mathematics for much of my early adult life, culminating in doctoral studies at the University of Liverpool. I now build end-to-end machine learning systems (preferably trained on living datasets) that solve problems I care about. 

I genuinely enjoy programming, take immense pride in whatever I'm able to create, and am constantly looking for ways to expand my skills. 

### Why Is My Github So Empty?
I've moved virtually [all of my repositories](https://codeberg.org/kobinabrandon?tab=repositories) to Codeberg (a community-run code hosting service owned a German non-profit). 

I'm not comfortable with Microsoft's use of all our open source code to train the model behind Github Copilot for their profit, and I believe that in doing so, they've gone against the spirit of the copyleft open source licences. I believe that this is a deeply unethical practice, and that vendor lock-in is being used to hold us hostage on Github while Microsoft works as hard as it can to automate our job away under the guise of making it "easier" - while profiting from the increasing dependency on LLMs by developers in the process.

### Why is this account still here then?
I will be using this account to contribute to open source projects that are hosted on Github, and I will be keeping an archived version of one of my projects here. It's an end-to-end ML [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/Hourly-Divvy-Trip-Predictor) that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. You can interact with it [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/). Further development of this system will take place on Codeberg.
