### Who am I?
I'm a budding Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage. 

After studying mathematics for much of my early adult life, I decided that a career in academia wasn't for me, and that I'd rather build things, specifically, complete machine learning systems that solve problems I care about. 

### Projects
I'm currently building multiple free and open source end-to-end ML systems (all licenced under GPLv3):
  - a batch scoring ML service that provides hourly predictions of how many arrivals and departures will take place in Chicago's Divvy bike sharing system.
  - a machine translation service that uses pretrained transformers (and I'd like to experiment with building one from scratch).
  - a vision project that identifies mushrooms using images, and proceeds to provide further information on said mushroom.
  - a real-time service that's yet to be fully conceptualised.

### Other Interests
- Beyond my personal professional goals, I would like to somehow apply my skills to contribute in some small way to the technological and economic advancement of my fellow Africans.
- I also harbour a growing interest in embedded machine learning, as I'd like to be able to use my systems to extend the functionality of cameras, sensors, and other devices so that they can serve new purposes. For this reason, I am interested in adding a lower level compiled language to my skillset.
