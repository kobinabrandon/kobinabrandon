Hi there.

Because I don't want my personal projects to contribute to the training of Github's copilot, I've moved [all of my repositories](https://codeberg.org/kobinabrandon?tab=repositories) to Codeberg, and will use this account to contribute to open source projects that are hosted on Github. 

I am however keeping an "archived" version of one of my projects here. 

It's an end-to-end ML [system](https://github.com/kobinabrandon/Hourly-Divvy-Trip-Predictor) that provides hourly predictions of the number of arrivals and departures that take place at thousands of locations across Lyft's bikeshare system in Chicago. You can interact with it [here](https://melodious-wisdom-production-2431.up.railway.app/). Though it's a modest personal project, it has a number of forks (all of which are currently inactive). Active development of the system will continue on Codeberg.
