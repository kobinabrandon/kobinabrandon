### Who am I?
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) of Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage. 

After studying Mathematics for much of my early adult life, I took an interest in machine learning and data science. Now I build complete end-to-end ML systems (preferably trained on living datasets) that solve problems I care about. 

### Other Interests
- Beyond my personal professional goals, I would like to somehow apply my skills to contribute in some small way to the technological and economic advancement of my fellow Africans.
- I also harbour a growing interest in embedded machine learning, as I'd like to be able to extend the functionality of cameras, sensors, and other devices so that they can serve new purposes. For this reason, I am interested in adding a lower level compiled language to my skillset.

### My Stance on Coding Assistants (Copilot, TabNine, Codeium, Cursor .etc).
To put it simply, **I categorically refuse to use them**. 

I believe that these tools pose a clear and present danger to anyone who wants to be a good programmer, and remain so. In their current and most popular configurations, these tools often suggest code before one has even had the opportunity to think independently, repeatedly tempting us to choose their suggestions over our own thoughts. 

I submit that over time, this pattern of behaviour will cause our skills to atrophy, creating feelings of discomfort in habitual users who are suddenly forced to do without them. I only use LLMs when I have specific questions about how functions within a given library work, and I'm completely opposed to giving them access to any of my codebases in order to receive suggestions from them.
