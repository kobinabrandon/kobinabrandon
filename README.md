### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kobina, and I'm a mathematician who's aspiring to be an excellent Machine Learning Engineer (MLE). I have Ghanaian, Sierra Leonean and British heritage, and I'm deeply interested in applying my growing skills in machine learning development to the scientific, technological, and economic advancement of the African continent and its people. 

Barring some personal catastrophe, I'm not going to stop completing end-to-end ML projects of various kinds until I am as close to being one of the best MLEs on the continent as I can be.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Streamlit web application that predicts user demand for a bike-sharing service in the Chicago area, and provide relevant analytics.

- ðŸŒ± No matter how accurate a model is, it has no business value if it hasn't been deployed as a useable service which displays actionable predictions in a manner that is appealing and easy to understand. Iâ€™m currently learning different methods of doing exactly that.
   
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating with others on virtually any project, as I'm eager to learn about as many machine learning architectures, and methods as possible.
